# Toxic brother(25M) of my girlfriend(20F), and me(22M) tries to keep me away from her, he is a drunk, drugs, smokes weed, typical chapri(goon), parents told him to die more than 100 times because of his actions. how to handle it in future? How well did i handled it?

**CONTEXT>>**

So i am in a relationship with my girl from last 3 years and we love each other and want the relationship to go forward.

Now comes her older brother(25M), who do drugs and been hospitalised 2 3 times for it, drinks every time and comes home, has been kicked out of home several 100x times by parents, parents don't talk with him, does not goes to job etc etc.

**MAIN STORY>>**

So me and her stay in same area, so whenever we go out or she wants to be dropped off somewhere then i pick her and drop her over. So from last 3 4 days he watched us going together while i was dropping her off to her house, and then today( when she was late to her work she told me to drop her and i normally pick her and was going on the road, then he saw us, seeing us angrily and called her and told her to take my scotty on side, so he wants to basically wants to beat me and brought one of his friend with him, and we parked aside the road and he comes and starts shouting on her, who is he?, i have seen you with him from last 3 4 day a lot, what is with him, give me you phone(which she didn't), and during all this scene she was crying continuously, and want she knew that her brother was a psycho and can do anything as on the basis of his description above you can know what type of person he can be.

so he started swearing on me and saying (_bhenchod gand mar dunga teri,milna mat meri behen ke sath firse)_Â and so on. I got a bit anxious at that time as it was all of sudden, but i calmly told him that, okay i wont be with her anymore etc etc, while he was shouting on me, and as per what kind of person he is ,I thought of not confronting with him and i just got away as there was no point of staying there as he was not in the mood to listen what i want to say.

we don't want to reveal our relationship to her parents, and she is a bit emotional girl and cries a lot in such situation.

and i know it will happen again, because people like this don't understand anything and don't want to listen to anyone.

**MAIN CONCERN>>**

Did I handled the situation as it should be or I should have done something else(which I think might have escalated the situation). and what can I make sure of in future or should consider as this situation might appear again.
