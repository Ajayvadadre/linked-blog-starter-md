## knowing yourself as well as you do what makes it hard to live with you?
- That i am a bit self obssesd
- That i am little selfish\
- That i might manupilate the other for my own will(skeptical about this)
- That i sometimes might be in my old world and ignore the other 
- That i will say the other to do a thing that i even not able to do 
- That i dont easily give in or commit to the things.
- That i wont be able to be on par the other might be expecting me to
- That i might not do the obvious thing to do at that time when needed 
- That i sometimes think too much about what people will think of me
