What's the thing i am going to do today, i dont know myself so just writing, or typing to be specific, because it felt to write down whatever its coming to my mind as well feeling exhausted after using twitter for a time, dont know why , but for the first time got into the loophole of twitter, just filled my brain with unwanted information, just for the sake of some pleasure i guess, or dont know why i did that, but anyway feeling little low by comparing myself to others on twitter, little exhauseted after using it for a while, what i did today?, nothing just making brochures and designs and every other thing than working on a website which i was thinking i will be doing and i am not, right now i am in a kind of loophole, or a rut of should i stay in this company or leave this and take a month of break study again about everything and go on with finding new jobs, even if there are any, right now not feeling confident enough to go on a interview, and plus dont know how i will manage to go to interview as i am in the job i earned kind of 60 to 70k from last 5 months or so , and i dont know , i know what to do but the moment i think about doing it or think about it, another thought comes that its time now and
