It feels childish to sometimes write things coming to my mind because it makes me feel like i am some kind of a child that doesnt know anything and is getting angry and frustated at small things which i should not on and getting carried away, i dont know why i feel like this or the way i percive this things are different or is not acceptable by society i dont wanna blame on anything i just feel sometimes like am i the wrong person? or should i change myself to a person that people like? should i be what i am or should i change some things that are not right, so that i am not descarded from society, do i feel good alone? yes, but i also dont feel comfortable alone sometimes, when i am anxious or stresssed, i want people around me, i am little frustrated by my performance on the tasks that i should perform or the way i want to perform is not , i am feeling sleepy, kind of exhausted, demotivated, as my dopomine is below baseline due to a fucked up thing i did last night, am i dick?, i think of myself as a person that is good with the people around me, listens to other people, but does'nt talks sometimes when needed, or i dont know if its bad to do or so, and i am capable of doing some things , i think that people think that i am smart, i know somethings, i i am addicted, i am distracted, i do a lot of procrastination , why?, because i am afraid that i have wasted so much time and there is no way i am going to be successfull in this tasks as i should started earlier and now i am lacking the motivation to move forward with this thing, but in hindsight i also know this is not the way i should think, but this thought doesnt seems that much valid than the negative points appear to be.
