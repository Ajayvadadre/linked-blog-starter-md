# Motivation comes and go but Descipline is constant 

 So trying to write through my mind, just braindumping, feeling little dizzy and somewhat sleepy.considering to go for sleep , not most focused, saw something on reel saying something about asking the same 3 4 questions daily and writing about it and taking an  hour off to read them through and find some patterns in it, also heard about that writing down your thoughts is a good thing and practise to improve your vocabulary in english, i speak good english sometimes when i feel i am confident but i dont know why i sometimes fumbble , its like i think or overthink about the thoughts too much and sometimes getting anxious, mostly anxious to be honest, also feeling slow again and deprived, reading a lot about how motivation is a temporary thing and it wont last forerver, which i noticed and experienced is true as i have gone throught that face sometimes, but descipline is constant, as we do the things anyway even if the curcumstances dont allows it, but you know what when i dont fap for a 3 4 days in row, i feel motivated and clear headed mostly, and its like i can take a step forward to do the thing, and this MF shoulder is started to pain as if its the most disgusting thing i dont like about my body rightnow, its like everything in my body is paining every fucking time, why? i guess i fucked up big time by seating on chair for a long period of time and now i am facing the consiquences of it, it had altered my gym training a lot as i cant carry heavy weights because my joints and muscles of the shoulder will give up way before even the muscle i am training will be which is frustating, i know i have the things to improve my muscle imbalance and i should do it daily, but you know what? i am fucking kind of little bit afraid or i dont know i dont have words to say so , which i also learned from lot of podcasts that you sometimes dont have words to describe the emotions that you are feeling, so anyways, i am kind of embaraseed that what will other trainers, people will be thinking of me when i do all those activites, but i also am realising is that then wtf did payed for? dont you think you should use it according to your own need as well, like dude? why and what are you afraid of, they will not like me? right so let it be, i know its hard to sunk in but you were pretty confident back then and you did what you wanted to, so bring back that confidenece and commitment again, i also dont wakeup by my own now a days bc, i have to rely on nilam to call me daily to fucking wake me up , which i dont like, its like its tampering my ego and degrading my image in front of here,i dont know why i am not pushing hard, why i am waiting for something to happen and then only i will be like, now i will change, i know that wont last forever, but i can't just sit and wait it to happen, i want to be in that beast mode and dont wanna look here and there whats happening, why is that other people are able to do it and i am not? whats the difference in them and me, why? what am i lacking? what is it that i am waiting for, i have got too comfortable and too much distraceted, i know meditation can solve most of this issues quickly, i know cause i have experienced it, i should be doing it daily, instead of doing nothing and indulging in the phone at night, i will rather do the meditation, its like everyone is going forward and i am stuck and i know everyone have there own problems but i have to focus on myself, i have to start with the basics, like sleep, meditation, exercise, food,atleast this will somehow clear my mind i guess, i mean lets hope soo...
