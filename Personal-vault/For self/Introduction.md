I have professional experience working as a MERN stack developer at Connectix, where I primarily focused on frontend development with Next.js. Additionally, I worked as a WordPress developer/administrator at Alumak, where I managed the company's WordPress website, handled Google Ads campaigns, and contributed by designing catalogs and brochures.

I am proficient in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for frontend, SQL for databases, and Node.js for backend development. I am also familiar with libraries like Bootstrap and Tailwind, along with a few others.

I am eager to collaborate with a team on exciting projects to continue honing my skills and gaining valuable experience.
