## Comparison, trust, hardwork.... its tough
- So this is the end of the month, lot happened in this month, feels like it was long month,
this was a good overall month, did lot of things from my birthday to the ganesh festival, i enjoyed it , also feeling little dizzy and in kind of foggy state right now, because yesterday i was on a bike ride the entire day and we both got home by 2 and then i fapped at that night as well, still not able to go beyond the 3rd day again, and now again in the spiral of getting out of this shit, i just want to get out and i dont like this feeling of haze and dizziness and i want to be clear headed, i also think i should now do the meditation practise i did a year ago atleast consistently atleast the Octuber that is going to come from tomorrow, also i should grind more, its like i am in a middle of not a bad situation but also in a place where its not good either, which in according to me is worst where i can be in, lot of people online also says the same, sometimes i get fucking confused by the load of information that comes to me and just doesnt makes sense, i havent sleept enough, and i want to sleep atleast decent enough so that i can gain the little clearity i like to have, i dont know man, people are killing it outside, it motivates me to do the action, but also stops me and says to me that dont do it you might fail in it buddy, its not a good decision to give in to the thing i am preparing my self to, its also uncertain where i am going in, as i am late to this industry and its already way ahead and i fear that i will be jobless and the time i spend in developing this skills will be of no use thats the main fear i can notice i have to give in to the situation on this, i dont know why i am not in the go..goo.gooo moment, right now i am just lazy and that's for sure i can say about me in the current situation i am right now, i am not even able to fucking write this journal as its feeling dizzy and i am just not in the grove, the thoughts are all foggy, they are not clear, i dont have a clear understanding of where i am going, feeling of regret is there, feeling of i should have done this that etc, and then i dont know, loving my relationship a lot lately, just feels good and natural to me , which i always wanted, there are still some issues in it, but i know we will take it sportingly enough to understand each other, right now i just love her, dont know why feeling it more from since s
