## Feels Good

- Today is monday and i just reach office , and while coming here was in a bit lot of traffic , which is generally normal in mumbai, got here, and wifi is off due to some reason and now waiting till mam comes and gives us the number of the wifi person to call to , until i thought i should write something down, as i am taking the rhodiola rosea everyday from last 3 to 4 days , there isn't much of a difference i can see till now, or might be seeing some effects but it's not that visible, but trusting the capsule i might see some effectsðŸ™ƒ.
- The month is almost over and i am going to leave this company and i dont have any other job at hand to go to, but what i was thinking is i will leave this company, give myself a little time and prepare for the interview a bit and then start applying and then i would be a bit confident enough to go forward, also thinking or comparing myself lately a lot to other people and my friends that are earning more and i think that are going to be successfull and i am going to be stuck here forever, but today doesnt feel that much of it as i have not f#p from last 1 day so feeling good and want to complete the course that i have purchased for 3500 and its a bit long course TBH and i dont want to keep learning for so long and compelte atleast a bit that can get me atleast a decent job in it and then i can continue forward accordingly,
