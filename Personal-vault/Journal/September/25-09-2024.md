# Quiet boring(imp)
- Today i thought i will be going to the factory of the company that i work in to meet the person that was going to give me details regarding the catalogue that i am making from last 3 months and i didnt gone there, because he was out of station, whatever, i noticed that i waste time a lot in unnessasry things rather than working on the things i should be and when i think on working or basically studying regarding the coding skills that i am studying to gain feels like waste of time and i should not do that, and just now a thought emerged that, then what will you do either?, dude thats also a thing to consider that i didnt noticed till today and just noticed right now, its true i have wasted some time, a loottt of time, in just gaining the bare minimum of the skills that i should have got under the time i gave myself to train into, i got 6months that i should have dedicated and learnet about the skill that i was pursuing right, and i still have a bit of a regret and a bit of shame and all regarding it and its not like other people are going to tell me that i did the wrong thing and i should be ashamed of the time i wasted and as i write about this i start feeling a bit of ashame and guilt of wasting that time, i dont regret about the money, but i regret the time i spend on a wrong course or just like i should have used that time basically and just have gotten the skills till now and i would have been in a great place right now, and as i write this, the future me would have thought the same regarding me right? that instead of regreting the time i wasted i should have worked on myself atleast somewhat and then gained decent skills to atleast enter the market, i got this feeling that i am late, i wasted my time, i should regret about it, what will other people think about me or what will the company that is going to hire me will think about me , like they will say that you wasted a lot time, what were you doing in this time, why didnt you used this time and gained better skills, why ajay why, is there any worth crying about that rightnow, even if i say i should forget it , its not going to get fade away that easily, you know why??, because i am not working dedicatedly on the things i should be and the people that started before me on the social media that i am looking are way more ahead then me and i am kind of jelous of them and i think its a good thing in itself also, 
- I feel like sometimes i am repeating the same things again and again and again, and its not helping me in any way, so i guess, i should just let it go? dekh bhai usko hold karke bhi tu agge nahi badh raha , vaise to nahi badh raha which is the truth tujhe accept karna hi padega brother, teremai hai chize karne ka , but somehow i think that sometimes ki i just lost my confidence, self esteem a bit and also started critisizing a lot, i dont know if i am even just procastinating right now just to avoid the work i am writing things down, but to be honest, i dont feel that thing as a work or like a ressistance towards coding has been a little less this days.
- I am going to leave the company soon and then i wont have any job or anything after that, i dont even think of applying anywhere as i think i have forgotten a lot of things and i have to remember them again so that i can atleast start applying there and dont know man, kaha tha, kaha aa gaya hai bhai tu, better hua hai tu but still confidence kam hua hai in certain way, kuch chize realise karne laga hu which i still somehow dont want to accept but are i guess true and i think i might be the only one to understand it. 
- Waiting for the future ajay to look in this journals and just smile and shy away that fuck i have written this thing and now i am here in this place with atleast decent things , but bhai ek baat bolu, tu tension na lee, jaha bhi rahega tu khudme khush rhega or khush rhe bhai, jyada na sochna jo hai krlega tu, abhi vala mai thoda hu aalsi, hu thoda dara hua sa, thoda confused, thoda frustated, thoda fucked, thoda unemployed XD, but bhai kar lunga jitna hoga mere se, pr agge tu kar jo hoga karle , mai karunga mere taraf se, agar ye jorunal somehow bach gaya or mai abhi 22 ka hu or tu isko 5 6 saal baad dekhe to bhai mai tereko apne sapne pure karte hue dekhna chata hu , QKi abhi ka mai to nhi dekh paonga vo to tu majje pure lena bhai, enjoy karna, maa baap ka khayal rakh, healthy rhee sb acha hoga tension na lee, jo bhi kiya or karega tu future mai uske liye thankyou or bsdk sharma mat padhte hue ye chiz smjha, enjoy kr chal love you mere bhai ajay!!
