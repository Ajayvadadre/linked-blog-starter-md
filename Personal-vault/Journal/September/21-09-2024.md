# What's the Point?
- So what's the point of what am i doing?, why am i doing?, why do i want to leave the company that i am working on and i would rather sit at home and do the so called "Prepare for interview", why i want to feel embarace of where i am working, i am embaraced by the image that people will have of me that i am working in this ugly place and i am not successfull, should that matter me?, No , but it is mattering me , why? because i created a image in my mind that i would be working in a big MNC that will be beautiful, i will be a smart person in that office and i will grow from that point onwards, why?
- I thought i will be working in a atleast a decent place to start with, but i am literally at the bottom of the place or work i wanted to do or pursue and there is always someone fucking in i think everyones life that is way ahead and he or she are doing the things that i wanted to do, but thinking like this is not good right?, i should adjust according to wherever i will get to do the work and get the money to do soo. but isnt there that much of thing i can or i should atleast expect or dream of, and leave in that case if i dont get the place as well as the work i want to do, i know i am not in the position or at the skill level that i would get the things or work i want to do, and i dont know why i am irritated today, its just there is now less than 10 days remaining or a week only where i will work here and then i am going to take a exit without a job and i know it sounds foolish and why the fuck i am leaving without getting another job?, i know it makes sense and i know its the good thing to do, but i think its enough now and i should have did the things i said i will do and prepare for this moment before hand, which i missed again, but this time with a job, i did the same thing 6 months ago with the offline course i took and same way wasted the 6 months without getting the proper training and without learning enough and bhenchod didnt utilised the time i should i have done.
-  I just got the chai for everyone, i feel soo embarassed to go around the college as i feel that i would be seen by someone that knows me from that clg and will ask me what am i doing and where i am working and i cant just tell them where i am working, dont know why i feel this, i sometimes feel i am taking things too much seriously and sometimes i think i am taking things too much lightly, like wtf is happening with me or is this even a privilage that i can think about this things and i would not about this things if i havent had any money with me or in my family, see i know i have a cushion behind me that gives me time to take the risks and do whatever i want, till a certain point, and touch wood we dont have much prblms for now, but i know there can be at any moment , that the family might need my support at that time, and i want to help them at that time rather than regret at that time that i just wasted the time and was fucking around, but then the thought comes that you have a bit time dude, then the thought comes that dude you are 22 and i was like i was juts 21 and in a blink of eye i turned 22 and fuck i need to do something right now. and instead actually doing the thing i am just circling aroung it and avoiding it because its hard and it will take time so rather than doing it i just should forget even doing it a bit 
- I am just fed up by this shit now man, like kitna bhai or kitna yehi chiz baar baar even if i know what should i do and i am just like in a fucking loop dude , i know that i am being a dick and now a days i started to think like i dont have the spine to take things and just let it go and do the things dude, like i am a crybaby for fucking sake, i know i am thinking negative and overthinking a lot, but what else now , like bhai tereko koi nahi ane vala bachane, you have to hold your own fucking hand and just do it bhaii, karle bhenchod ho jayega kuch to start kar bhai bs kar, ho jayega bc kar tu mai hu....
