i worked in a company called Connectix for almost 2 months and there i was working as a web developer, where i was handed over the task to reopen a project of this company where the project was basically a website that was a mixture of linkedin and instagram and mainly catered towards the people of Tv serial industries and etc, so i was hired first person to work on that project, and i completed my graduation in 2023 and took a 6 months full stack developer course from nettech india andheri where i learned almost not much, and kind of wasted my 6 months there and then after completing the course and waiting extra 2 months for the job until the connectix job , where i still did'nt knew much and worked there for 2 months almost somehow and then left the company as company was giving me 6000rs permonth and that too they only gave me 5600 rs only so i joined the company by 14th march and left it by the end of april and then just joined another company called agfs or alumak , which is mainly a facade manufatcturing company and they hired me for there website , i got to it mainly through my friend who left after working for 2 months, and so i joined here by 1 may and till today it might be the start of the 5th month i guess, and there was some work at the begineeng 1 month and also i am using my personal laptop, where i have to travel by BEST bus of mumbai from dahisar anand nagar to kashigaon, which i think is hectic with the laptop and can damage it maybe, so still i am using my personal laptop and they are not providing me any other laptop, also i am not working on things like on websites from last 4 months and there is not much work to do , the pay i am getting here is 14000rs per month, and i dont do much daily , but this company doesnt have any proper office or something, its just a chawl house that is built into an office, i had to do other things instead of working on what i wanted to do, also the website that i maintain is on wordpress which i dont want to work with as i think doing career in mern stack technologies or similar to them is better for me than working on wordpress websites, so its been 4 months till now , i was also not doing much studies or learning about the things i should to switch to different job and 4 months have been passed by , so i am kind of getting little nervous about somethings, i wanted to leave this company, but i dont have a job at hand, i was thinking to leave this company and stay at home and work on my skills for 1 month and start to find jobs again in which i wanted to work in like in mern stack or as a react dev, but i dont have the confidence also i have forgot somethings, so how i will apply for a job if i am not ready, as i have forgotten somethings, and i will have to work on them before applying anywhere, so today is 2nd sep and i was thinking to do this month as last month here and take the bet to leave this job and work on myself for 1 month and then go applying for new jobs, but there is also another thought that appears after i think in this way, that there is not much work to do here anyway, so i can work on myself here itself and then apply after i am prepared enough and then take the decision of leaving this company, but then i start thinking that i havent did anything from last 4 months, even if i got time to do on myself as the place where i sit, there are other people also in this office, and my senior sometimes comes from behind and he looks into what i am doing then i have to stop in middle and pretend i am doing the work, which incase there is none to do , there is some work i can do like i also run there google ads, i have been running 2 ads just for the sake of running them as they told me to run the ads, but i am not interesetd in google ads, and i dont want to work on it, i just come office do some timepass here and there and i also get told to make brochers and pamplets , invitation cards etc, which is not much of a work and also i like making them , but i dont know if its good to stay here more or i should do this month and leave, i am confused on what to do , some of friends are saying dont leave the job until you get another one, but i dont want to work here, because i am kind of board and also i think i might not study even if i stay here and say that i will wait here and study and get prepared for another job and then only leave, this are some thoughts i am getting lately , this thoughts are raw and i dont know where i am heading in life and where i might go, so want to take the best decision in this situtation which i dont know which one is, there are other things related to this also, so feel free to ask if you have any other questions that might help you to clear some things.

its not like i have any financial requirement right now, or i have to focus on the finance right now , as my family is earning decent enough and i dont have to provide them money in some cases, yeah but having money is something i got to know that provides a kind of freedom to do whatever i want but thats not the main focus right now, also i think i have got into a comfort zone of myself where i dont have much to do in office and still able to earn enough so i got into the comfort zone, so i thought leaving the job might create atleast some fear in me that i should study now or else i will be jobless again so that i also one persepective of mine

Should i extend one more month? but by doing this i think that my credibility will be little loose, as i am saying that i will leave next month from last 3 months to my boss, even if my boss dont want me to go still he will think that when the moment i will say i will leave the next month is the last one then he will think again that he is just saying and not leaving kind of which is not a big deal its just i am giving my thoughts to you so help me as if i was your little brother

My main goal right now is to gain a skill and grow in that particular skill, but then another thought also occurs of the past , where i was in connectix and was working on which i wanted to and was where i wanted to make my career on, but after working for 10 to 15 days i started getting stressed out, got frustations, always been nervous if i am good enough to pursue this as a career, was not able to sleep and was anxious because it was a remote job and i was alone working on the project and i would have to answer the boss by having a meeting in morning and a meeting in evening discussing about what is completed and what is remianing and everytime at eveing i would be nervous as what i would say as i havent did much enough , and was not able to compelete some tasks which was given at that time , and it was really frustating of not able to complete minor bugs and tasks without the help of you and other AI i would not be able to do anything and sustain for 2 months, i was stressed at that time i also cried in front of my mother , would stay up by 2am at night still trying to solve issues and bugs etc which were minor and thinking that if i am not able to solve this things then how will i even sustain and grow in this career as i am not able to compelete simple tasks, but thinking about it now i get to understand that i also learned a lot but i also am little scared of even if i got selected in next job will i able to do things? as i dont have the skills it takes , i know it but i also regret i wasted the 6 months of course time i got and didnt learned much at that time, also does not have much better projects to show,and even after getting a job was not able to perform better and got so much stressed in just 1-2 months that i cant explain, and after that now this situation that i got a job of 14k and there is not much to do and i again didnt used this time to prepare myself and get into a job i wanted to work in, i know its my fault but still this things come up to me sometimes, it also concerns me that i am 2023 graduate, used 6 months for course after that got a job of where i want to work on but worked for only 2 months there and then got again a job as a web developer but in a wordpress developer, and that too only for 1 month, where there was not major things or changes i made, and after that just working on other things only, so will i be considerd fit or will be considered as a old graduate with not much skills in MERN or related tech , this thoughts are also not clear TBH. so this is also what i wanted you should know

okay so i think i will use this time of september to work on myself properly this time and i will focus on my studies , and if i dont feel that i am not going anywhere with this then i will leave this job and use another 1 month that means total of 2months to practise until i am confident and decent enough to get a another job and i dont know as the current market situation is not that great

so how should i go with this as i have only basic knowledge of MERN stack and i dont have good problem solving skills as well, i would also have to revise the stack i once learned , so can you plan something for me , i wake up by 6.40 am go for swim, comeback do my morning things and leave by 9.30 and reach office by 10am or 10.30 max, and then take lunch break by 1 or 1.30pm and then again daily work if there is any and leave by 6.30 or 7-7.30 and reach home by sometimes 7.30 or 8pm depending on when i leave, after that dinner by 10 or 10.30 or sometimes i eat once i get home and dont need to have lunch at 10.30 and then i generally go to sleep by 11 or 11.30pm max , so this is the routine
