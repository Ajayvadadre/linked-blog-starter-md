Today is Saturday and i came to office as early as every time and sat down openeing my personal laptop i use for the companies sake, like sometimes i feel how big a dickhead i am and i dont understand why i dont feel anything about my things, like i feel that if something happens to my laptop for example i will not feel much as my mind thinks or i think that its fine it is repairable and i have enough money to repair it and also by using the laptop for companies use which to be honest i think that i am not using it that much for them then for me the only thing that hits me every time is that i have to travel with it in the buses and etc , which will i think damage my laptop and reduce its life span, i dont want that feeling that i have enough that like i will take a new laptop if this one is gone, i know there is money enough to take a decent laptop but i dont want to , just like how i felt for my watch at the time it was robbed, i didnt feelt much at that time but i am feeling the need or missing that watch, cause i loved my watch like hell , i desperatley want it again, also have the money , but it could have been saved if i would have took care of it properly, but i dont know i dont blame it as my mistake, but it is as i should be aware of it that my things would or could get robbed from fucking inside the house like seriously i was not ready for it, but now fully aware of it and i think i might buy the same watch again as i loved it the way it was i think. 

  and speaking about the job, i am not prepared fully so i dont think leaving this month is good, and i think this is and should be my last month here and gonna defiently going to leave this job after this month for sure and use this month as good as possible to practise and revise some topics again and gain that mindset and confidenece of getting the job again and hope so of getting a good job , lets grind this month, have been fapping from last 3 days continously and i am aware of it and i think i should do something about it or else according to me doing something about it doesnt works for me instead i should do something other than that instead of stopping it , that will help me better according to my experience, and i also got to know that its not the big picture in my life, yes its it might be one of the bigger factor that might be contributing to the lazziness and procastination of what i am doing that's for sure so i am going to stop it however it might be possible as i am addicted to it and it doesnt serve me anything better , it just makes me slow, it makes me lazy, it makes me brainfogged and fucked up , it reduces my focus and so on, so overall it just gives me negative impact on my life and i have noticed myself feeling better when not doing or fapping for some days.
