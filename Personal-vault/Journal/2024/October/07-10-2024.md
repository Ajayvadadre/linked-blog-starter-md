# Time is real 
- The more i waste it the more i got to know about it is that time is really real :)
in a blink you can waste your 2 hrs straight without even knowing and obviously i am writing this after wasting some time :') and the moment i realised it the time is already wasted.

why is human like this? why we do this? why are we build to feel more pleasure and not take the pain on the face and just perform the task. As i know that i am 22 years old, I should work on myself, this is the only time i will be getting to show what i am and take as much exposure as i can, right? It literraly feels like i am in a cycle, the videos i watch, the things i listen to , the podcast i listen, is all for none, because i am not taking action, and logically also it sound right, if you multiply 20x90x200 and then multiply it by 0 its all again to 0 my friend, and i dont know why am i not realising it, even if i can see that i am lacking and procastinating, fucking self aware and shit, the only thing stoping me right now and is a struggle, is that i am not taking the action, and i know i do this everytime, and think through it and just write and stuff and feel that i have done some work and achieved something. 

There is no going back to when i was a 18 and just like that 2024 is almost over and its already 7th day of the octuber dude , if not now then when i thought that i will be in better place and thought that i will be working in a good company and learn and shit, but the last 5 months in the current company taught me a good leasson  that no one is coming to save you brother its just you just YOU, i always thought that i am a smart person and think that its nothing, what is important is that what i am right now? what am i ? a 2023 graduate, wasted his 6months in a course that would have been usefull and after that joining a shit company and wasting 6 months there ,
