So today i fucked up a bit, i deleted my old notes made in the obsidian and all the journals i had made till then are now gone, yes, but for god's sake i can i back it up in my github which will never delete my files even if i fucked up again.
I am preety much down right now as i have masturbated more than i should have in the weekends i got, i also did a lot of procastination and has not done anything productive, just doomed scrooled twitter, and youtube and just round and round done same thing for straight 3 days, like 3 fucking days i just wasted and here i am writing this down regreting the things i had done and should have used this time more usefully, and not have wasted it, but you know i dont know where i am, i feel lost, non motivated, depressed as fuck, and not have any motivation to do anything and i know the resaon of it but fuck dude, i dont like to be like this at all, like how shitty i am feeling right now, its like worst feeling i can have, like i have really fucking 0 motivation to do anything, feeling groogy and shit, not able to focus for long, fading out while writing this down. 
I also missed the gym for straight 4 days, like dude, whatsup with me, i dont like this version of me tbh, and i am here just venting my things out and not doing the shit that is hard and i know i am procastinating it due to its nature, like humans like to do easy shit and feel good about it and not push self to the max just because of that small fucking thing, like i just lost all the shit i wrote dude, i had my frustations, my regrets, my followups, my happiness, like i feel i should have been a bit responsible to atleast my shit dude. 
I dont want to feel like this man, i also fucking ditched the plan of going out with my gf like i know i should have told her before, she is mad at me and thats fair as fuck, like dude if it was me i would have felt same, and i am ditching her like she is nothing doesnt seems good to me, and i know she understands it, and i dont like the tension we are having in between us right now , and i know that will be sorted soon , but its just i dont like this feeling of been disconnected with myself and lost in somewhere, anxious as fuck. 
I also gave some money to my friend and i dont have any negative things about it, its just when i look into my account its showing less money then i thought i would have kept like dude there is only 6k remaining in my account right now and i have gave him 2700rs, currently its 20 april and i have to survive till 1 dude its almost 2 weeks.
Dont know man whats happening, also forgot to tell that i guess helped a girl i follow on twitter that stays in bandra like she was harrased by a beggar so i just commented and tagged it to mumbai police, which seems they say my tag and replied to it, so she thanked me, and i dont know why i feel good about it too much, like i know whats happeing behind the brains here i guess, like i am feeling like i have been recognised by some superior people then me, and i feel good about it, like its not bad, but i guess i dont like the reaction of me that is feels that desperate or that attention, like i dont wanna be that guy and want to be the guy that focuses on his own shit and i want to be commited to my girl, but sometimes feels like the connection we both have is weak, and i know it might be due to the shit i have been doing with my hands , like dude stop it and focus on your work why the fuck i do it, like i know its not at all good for me but still i fuck up with it like dude chill and do some productive work and i feel good not doing it like really really positive and motivational to do things, but after doing it i can fucking see in front of my eyes the negatives been coming up and taking me down again,
