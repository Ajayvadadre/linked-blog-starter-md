- var is part of Es5 and let, const are part of Es6, 
- var is not part of Es6 but browsers accept both Es5 combined with Es6
- Javascript is an interpreted language
- Google created a combinaton of both interpreter & Compiler which is also called transpiler , that is JIT
- JIT or just in time compiler uses both interpreter & Compiler properties.
- Javascript itself doesnt have its functions eg- console, document, alert etc.
- It borrows those functionalites from Window, or browsers window specifically.
